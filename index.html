          The very first installment of the beloved video game series was titled “NBA 2k”, and was developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega. The game's initial release date was 24 years ago on November 10, 1999, and was launched for gameplay on the Dreamcast. Every version of the game has its own “cover athlete”, and for the first installment of 2k it was the one and only Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers.

          Eventually, the game was released on other gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 2 and 3, Xbox, Xbox 360, and GameCube. The game featured fictional announcers, Rod West and Bob Steel. And of course, every current player in the National Basketball Association at the time. NBA 2k received high praise upon the game's release, with stunning visuals and controls. Scott Alan Marriott for AllGame highlighted the presentation style and called NBA 2k “a sports title that offers the graphics, playability, and artificial intelligence to convert nearly anyone who remotely enjoys the game of basketball into a hardcore fanatic”. The game even included playbooks by actual NBA coaches to make sure each team acts the way they do in real life. Although far from the greatest 2k game, it was the first of the iconic 2k franchise.

      <h3>Latest Edition: NBA 2k24</h3>

        The game franchise's latest installment of the NBA 2k series is NBA 2k24. It was released on September 8, 2023, and amassed over $6 million in sales in the first week. Simultaneously, the game sold 200,000 units in its first week. NBA 2k24 offers the most realistic basketball experience so far, placing a strong emphasis on personalization and creativity. In contrast to older models of 2k, 2k24 has a focus on primary game modes like MyCAREER and MyTEAM, where players can manage their own NBA team. This year's “cover athlete” was an obvious choice for 2k24, the late Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant famously wore number 8 and 24 during his career with the Lakers.

        Despite a great opening week in terms of sales, players were not happy with the game. Users reported multiple bugs and complained about the lack of innovation compared to previous installments. 2k24's ratings on Steam were not great, receiving 1 star out of 5, due to the game being plagued by technical glitches. Although the game may not be one of 2k's best, the franchise still has a loyal fan base who continue to buy the game year after year.
